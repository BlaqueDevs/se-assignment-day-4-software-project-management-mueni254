Conduct regular financial audits to track unnecessary expenses.
Effective cost control ensures that software projects stay on budget, deliver quality results, and maximize ROI. By using accurate cost estimation, agile tracking, optimized resources, and risk management, project managers can prevent budget overruns and ensure financial success.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Waterfall and agile are software development models. Waterfall is a linear and sequential model where the development process flows through a set of predefined phases:
Requirement Analysis: Gathering and documenting all project requirements upfront.
System Design: Creating detailed design specifications based on the requirements.
Implementation: Developing the actual software components.
Testing: Verifying that the software meets the specified requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the completed product to users.
Maintenance: Addressing any issues and performing updates post-deployment.
In this model, each phase must be completed before the next begins, making it challenging to accommodate changes once the project is underway. This approach is best suited for projects with clearly defined requirements and objectives.
By contrast, Agile is an iterative and flexible approach that emphasizes continuous collaboration and customer feedback. Projects are divided into small units called sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks, each encompassing:
Planning: Identifying goals and tasks for the sprint.
Development: Designing and coding the features.
Testing: Ensuring functionality and quality.
Review: Demonstrating the work to stakeholders and gathering feedback.
Retrospective: Reflecting on the process to identify improvements for the next sprint.
This cycle allows teams to adapt to changing requirements and incorporate user feedback promptly, making it ideal for projects with evolving needs.
Agile is flexible where waterfall is rigid once the project progresses beyond the initial phases. Agile also engages users throughout the development process as opposed to waterfall which engages at user development phase and on delivery. Agile therefore manages risk better as issues are identified and resolved and not at delivery phase where fixing may be costly


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile and Waterfall are two distinct project management methodologies, each suited for different types of projects. The choice between them depends on factors such as project complexity, flexibility, stakeholder involvement, and risk tolerance.
